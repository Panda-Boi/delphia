Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

In madness you dwell

Not dead, which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be
